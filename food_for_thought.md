### Food for thought

---

Here is a bunch of (awesome, or maybe awful) thoughts from me.



> When should you spend time on "meaningless" things like how to compile a driver from source?

Generally, I classify those things into:

1. A must-do. 
   1. Things like dev tools manual, fundamentals of sciences, etc. Example: "how to configure Pycharm to use conda venv?", or "What do `cmake` and `make` do?";
   2. Things that I can finish in a minute or two, like "what is `binutils`?".
2. Only if I am boring. Things will not boost my efficiency right now but may benefit me in the future. Example: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), [CppCoreGuidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md)
3. Heck no! 
   1. Things I'm completely unfamiliar with (like what's mentioned in the quote above, so that's why I switched to the ~~best~~ Linux distro, a.k.a., Windows Subsystem for Linux, xD);
   2. Things that take a loooooooooot of time but are most likely not helpful to my future career (in this case I usually pay -- if I could afford -- someone to do this for me, for example, Maya human skeleton rigging).
